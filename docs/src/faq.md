# FAQ

## How is scheduling different from Anki?

`repeater` schedules cards with the Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler (FSRS) targeting ~90 % recall, so you get dynamically computed intervals instead of SM-2’s fixed ease multipliers. Inside the drill UI there are only two buttons—`Pass` (`2`) and `Fail` (`1`)—which the code maps to FSRS quality scores of 3 and 1, respectively, while still applying the upstream stability/difficulty math plus the short “learning” ramp for your first few reviews. The end result feels faster to grade yet still reuses FSRS’s predictions.

## Where does my progress live?

Your decks stay in plain Markdown wherever you save them, but progress metadata (stability, difficulty, due dates, etc.) is tracked in `cards.db` under the platform’s application data directory (for example `~/Library/Application Support/repeater/cards.db` on macOS). Back up or sync that file if you want to keep review history when moving machines; deleting it resets scheduling without touching the Markdown decks.

## What happens if I edit or move a card?

Each card gets a hash that only looks at the actual letters, numbers, and any `+`/`-` signs. We ignore punctuation, spacing, and capitalization, so cleaning up commas or case won’t touch your streak. Rewrite the wording itself and you’ll start fresh. Moving blocks between files is safe because the text stays the same.

## Can I study ahead or repeat lapses immediately?

Yes. Anything due within the next 20 minutes is considered “due now”, so `repeater check` will show it and drills will surface it alongside overdue cards. During a session, cards that fail or return ultra-short intervals (under that 20‑minute window) are automatically added back into the current queue so you can clear them before quitting.

## Does the Anki import carry over scheduling data?

`repeater import` converts `.apkg` exports into Markdown decks today, but it does not migrate Anki’s per-card FSRS/SM-2 history yet. Imported notes will be treated as new cards and scheduled fresh once they’re indexed.

## I’m a developer—what’s the quickest way to run checks locally?

Use the `just precommit` recipe to run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --fix`, `cargo machete`, and the full test suite behind `SQLX_OFFLINE=true`. The Justfile also includes helper recipes for launching `repeater create`, `check`, `drill`, and `import` against sample data plus the release workflow, so contributors can rely on those instead of memorizing individual cargo commands.
